Machine-Learning
================

Just some bits and bobs for a machine learning course I'm trying to self-learn (and subsequently teach)

* ps1-linear-perceptron - Utilizing the linear perceptron algorithm to classify spam vs. non-spam e-mails (Python)
   * Link to the assignment: [goo.gl/lZelUU](goo.gl/lZelUU)

* ps2-gradient-descent - Utilizing gradient descent to implement a linear regression model on housing data (Python)
   * Link to the assignment: [goo.gl/rxkVJt](goo.gl/rxkVJt)

* ps3-support-vector-machines - Utilizing SVMs to classify MNIST digits data (R)
   * Link to the assignment: [goo.gl/rxkVJt](goo.gl/rxkVJt)

* ps4-logistic-regression: Implementing a simple logistic regression unit, useful for classifying MNIST digits (Python)
   * Link to the assignment: [goo.gl/l1Tiv2](goo.gl/l1Tiv2)

* ps5-pca-eigenfaces - Utilizing principal component analysis & eigenvectors to classify images of people's faces (R)
   * Link to the assignment: [goo.gl/KBs0AS](goo.gl/KBs0AS)

* ps6-conv-neural-networks - Utilizing keras & theano/tensorflow to classify MNIST, VGG-Net & CIFAR-10 data (IPython/Jupyter)
   * Link to the assignment: [goo.gl/3MIvIh](goo.gl/3MIvIh)
